# QuantPricer ðŸ§®

A modular C++ pricing engine for derivatives based on advanced stochastic processes and numerical methods.

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

**QuantPricer** is a quantitative finance simulation framework that models and prices financial derivatives under various stochastic dynamics.  
It is designed to be **modular**, **efficient**, and **extensible**, following object-oriented and SOLID principles.
